To achieve your desired functionality, hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how to design the app to dynamically build the `meals` list by interacting with the user:

### Features Breakdown:
1. **Dynamic Questioning**: Based on incomplete or missing information, the bot needs to ask follow-up questions.
2. **Incremental Updates**: As the user provides answers, the bot adds the information to the corresponding `Meal` objects.
3. **Meal Data Management**: Use the `MealContext` to store and update meals dynamically.
4. **Bot Response Logic**: Implement intelligent prompts and contextual conversations using `generateBotResponse`.
5. **User Interaction Handling**: Update state in `ChatProvider` as the conversation progresses.

---

### Implementation Steps

#### **1. Modify `generateBotResponse` to Extract Information**
Update `generateBotResponse` to process user input intelligently and extract relevant details (like days, meal type, preferences, etc.).

```javascript
async function tryToFillMealsWithTheUserAnswer(answer) {
  const extractedData = await generateBotResponse(`
    Extract the following information from the user's input:
    - Meal types (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner)
    - Number of people
    - Any ingredient preferences or restrictions
    - Days for meal planning
    - Specific dish suggestions

    User input: "${answer}"
  `);

  return JSON.parse(extractedData); // Assuming response is a JSON string.
}
```

---

#### **2. Handle Incremental Updates in `ChatProvider`**
Update the bot's conversation logic to dynamically add or modify meal information.

```javascript
const handleSend = async (message) => {
  if (!message.trim()) return;

  // Add user's message to the chat
  const userMessage = { role: 'user', text: message };
  setMessages((prevMessages) => [...prevMessages, userMessage]);

  // Analyze the user's response
  const extractedData = await tryToFillMealsWithTheUserAnswer(message);

  // Update MealContext based on extracted data
  if (extractedData) {
    const { meals, additionalQuestions } = updateMeals(extractedData);

    // Update meals in context
    setMeals((prevMeals) => [...prevMeals, ...meals]);

    // Generate bot's follow-up response
    const botResponseText = additionalQuestions.length
      ? additionalQuestions.join(' ')
      : 'Great! The meals are planned.';
    
    const botResponse = { role: 'bot', text: botResponseText };
    setMessages((prevMessages) => [...prevMessages, botResponse]);
  }
};
```

---

#### **3. Update Meals Dynamically**
Use the `Meal` class and `MealContext` to dynamically build meals based on extracted data.

```javascript
const updateMeals = (data) => {
  const { days, mealTypes, people, preferences, restrictions, dishSuggestions } = data;
  const newMeals = [];
  const additionalQuestions = [];

  days.forEach((day) => {
    mealTypes.forEach((type) => {
      const meal = new Meal();
      meal.setDate(day);
      if (dishSuggestions?.[type]) {
        meal.setRecipe(dishSuggestions[type].recipe);
        meal.ingredients = dishSuggestions[type].ingredients;
      } else {
        additionalQuestions.push(`What would you like for ${type} on ${day}?`);
      }
      newMeals.push(meal);
    });
  });

  return { meals: newMeals, additionalQuestions };
};
```

---

#### **4. Enhance Bot Personality**
Use a system prompt that defines the bot's personality and context. Update the `systemPrompt` dynamically.

```javascript
setSystemPrompt((prevPrompt) => `
  You are YumyYumy, a helpful cooking assistant. Here is the context:
  ${JSON.stringify(meals)}
  
  The user wants to plan their meals. Extract missing information by asking friendly questions.
`);
```

---

#### **5. Update the Meal Context**
Update the `MealContext` state to manage the list of meals as the user provides input.

```javascript
const addMeal = (meal) => {
  setMeals((prevMeals) => [...prevMeals, meal]);
};

const removeMeal = (meal) => {
  setMeals((prevMeals) => prevMeals.filter((m) => m !== meal));
};
```

---

#### **6. UI Update and Scroll Behavior**
Ensure the UI scrolls to the latest message in the chat.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  scrollToBottom();
}, [messages]);

const scrollToBottom = () => {
  chatEndRef.current?.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' });
};
```

---

### Example Output:

#### **Conversation Flow**
- **Bot**: *Hi, I'm YumyYumy and I'm here to help you to plan your meals for this week!*
- **User**: *Can you plan meals for the next two days?*
- **Bot**: *Sure! Do you want meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner or just dinner?*
- **User**: *Just dinner for two people.*
- **Bot**: *Noted! Any dietary restrictions or preferences?*
- **User**: *No crabs, but we love carrots.*
- **Bot**: *Great! How about carrot salad for tomorrow and spaghetti for the next day?*

---

### Final Meals Context:
```javascript
[
  new Meal('2023-11-13', ['carrots', 'lettuce'], 'Mix carrots and lettuce for a salad.'),
  new Meal('2023-11-14', ['spaghetti', 'tomatoes', 'ketchup'], 'Cook spaghetti and mix with tomatoes and ketchup.')
];
```

This structure allows your app to interactively build the meal plan while keeping the user engaged.
