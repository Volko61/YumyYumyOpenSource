# YumyYumyOpenSource

A AI-powered website that allows you to plan your meals for the week. You can test it here : https://yumyyumy.web.app (Completely free and no ads, no account creating etc)

For now it's french only. If someone translate the prompts for other languages it would be great. 
This code is fully open source, do whatever you want with it. You don't even have to credit me.
